# Thank you, Satoshi
## thxSatoshi
The Respect Token

**abstracts**

A certain [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto) created a socio-economic history based on cryptography, which revolutionized human society, the significance of which people will fully appreciate only later. But I am sure that the consequences of this revolution will be more ambitious than what we realize now.

thxSatoshi is a collectible meme token with a mission to convey or inform people about the importance of Satoshi's invention and say Thank you, Satoshi.

ticker - **thxS**

Any grateful and self-respecting KripTan or web3 community member "should" have at least 1 thxS token in his collection as a sign of appreciation and gratitude for his gift to us all.

Will be issued as a **multichain token** on multiple blockchains to potentially reach more people and communities by connecting them based on shared value. Functionally, this is a **native government utility**; any token on any blockchain will be native to DAOthxS.

Issue 21,000,000 on all blockchains.

The exact set of blockchains cannot be determined at the moment; much will depend on the communities that have joined us.

The idea is to issue 1,000,000 tokens on 21 blockchains.

**Mint**

Issue price of 1 token = 1 Satoshi.

All $Sat received go to the DAOthxS treasury.

**DAOthxS**

Any owner of the thxS token on any of the networks is a participant in DAOthxS.

The mission is to unite people and teams into a community based on a common cultural value respest Satoshi Nakamoto.

Educational activities. Creation of public goods. crossDAO interaction.

## token conept
"flat" design / wrapMechanics

A ‚Äúflat‚Äù token design is used, deliberately reducing the attack surface. Due to the multi-blockchain and different stacks, this will allow us to get a functional fork focused on the main goal of the Government utility.

wrapMechanics allow you to create almost any necessary interaction logic.

wrapNFT mechanics will complement and simplify the rest.

## ü™ÑTGEs thxS token
multichain Token Generetion EventS

The concept of fast scaling and launch.

**Multisig Bitcoin **

Bitcoin is created on the network and the custodians (core taem DAOthxS) undertake to transfer control of the assets to the DAOthxS community at the first request of the DAOthxS delegates, adopted by a majority vote.

This address is used to receive 1,000,000 Sat for all possible (21) TGE on any blockchain.

**TGE multichain**

Any group of willing enthusiasts (hereinafter referred to as subDAO team) informs the core team DAOthxS in Telegram @DAOthxS about the intention and jointly carry out goal setting to coordinate actions.

The subDAO team will create a **token thxS** in the selected blockchain corresponding to:


Title - **thxSatoshi**

Ticker - **thxS**

Emission - **1 000 000**

The contract must have the property of immutability in the future. The issue is final and cannot be changed.

Mint 1 000 000 thxS.

Creates an LP (Liquidity Pool) on DEX and loads it:

200,000 thxS / equivalent equal to 200,000 sat in the native token/liquid staking token of the blockchain - used to pay for transactions. (eth/wstETH for Optimism, TON/stTON for the TON network)

The subDAO command creates a multisig subDAOthxS (minimum 3/5) UPD (for the OP network there will be a Governor's CONTRACT)

Sends LP to multisig subDAOthxS. In fact, LP becomes an asset of subDAOthxS.

Transmits 400,000 thxS multisig subDAOthxS. They become an asset of the subDAO.

100,000 thxS is left as a reward for the team that completes the TGE.

300,000 thxS are transferred to DAOthxS vault/multisig.

Multisig custodians undertake to hand over control to the DAO upon request. This should be in the form of a vote/proposal using the thxS token.

Sent to multisig Bitcoin 1,000,000 Sat. In the comment to the transaction link to tx (mint 1,000,000 thxS)

They inform the community on Telegram [@DAOthxS](https://t.me/DAOthxS) about the fact of TGE.

core taem DAOthxS checks the correct execution of TGE, audits and verifies smart contracts. Enters token thxS (contract address) into the doc on gitbook and publishes on the website [thxS.xyz](https://thxs.xyz/), [twitter](https://twitter.com/thxSat), miror, forcast and other DAOthxS resources.

## R&D #1
#optimistic start

The first chosen network to be launched is Optimism. During the preparation and conduction of TGE+ research, an algorithm will be created that takes into account business logic / technological details / social aspects / obvious and hidden inconsistencies. As a result of the research, opDAOthxS will be launched and a UI will be deployed to manage the on-chain entity.

**The goals of this R&D are:**
* Emphasis on creating UX and identifying places to introduce organizational innovation in the format of some abstraction from the technology stack of specific networks, conceptually designing the evolution of the DAOthxS ecosystem as web2.5 - web3 - web3+
* The TGE ‚Äúpattern‚Äù is documented and structured with a set of options ‚Äúout of the box‚Äù, independent of network technology stacks and their degree of readiness. A "script" has been created for the future TGE team.
* SharingBot and miniAppSBT were designed for Telegram
* Gitbook, github, miroMap2024.
* RoadMap 2024
* Launched as MVP DAOthxS and opDAOthxS, allowing entity management using proposal chains.

**Dates:**
* Research: March - April 2024
* MVP testing and implementation: April - May 2024

## DAOthxS / subDAOthxS
GovermentS game

* Using the name Satoshi in this way, in my opinion, cannot be the prerogative of some project managed by anything other than a decentralized community. In other words, it is a public good and such SocialFi.
* If we consider thxSatoshi as a control of DAOthxS through 21 subDAOthxS, then all 21,000,000 tokenS (21 x 1,000,000) are exactly the same no matter what chain they are on. Based on this logic, all tokenS should have the same name and the same ticker thxS.
* Each subDAOthxS will have its own balance sheet/treasury and conduct fairly independent activities, since each (many) ecosystems will be unique and it makes no sense to discuss TokenomicS from this perspective now. DAOthxS will have some influence on these entities through ownership of a portion of the coins in each network, but nothing more.
* The price of tokenS in each chain, in my opinion, can and should be formed by market mechanisms. Especially given the trend towards support for ecosystem funds in each (many) networks by different communities and different TVLs in different networks. Again, each subDAO will have its own treasury, and there may well be different revenues; much/everything will depend on specific communities and network effects. And it‚Äôs not just about money, but in many ways about social/network/technological/others = XR (@Menaskop called it that in his research and I very much agree with him here). No one is stopping you from doing arbitration if it makes sense/purpose for someone.
* DAOthxS management is supposed to be carried out as a ‚Äúcongress of delegates‚Äù sent by each subDAOthxS from the ecosystem on identical conditions.. 1 delegate = 10,000 thxS votes, 1 delegate vote.. there can be multi delegates (for example) 1 delegate = 10,000 tonDAOthxS + 10,000 opDAOthxS , that's 2 votes.
* Genesis TGE phase (until the launch and orderly functioning of several networks, subDAO) DAOthxS is managed by a group of delegates ‚Äú101‚Äù.

The primary management of DAOthxS and opDAOthxS will be organized in the Optimism network through the Governor from OpenZeppelin contract on Tally and subsequently transformed/evolved according to the opinion of the community through proposals. OpenZeppelin offers options for implementing cross-chain mechanics for EVM (definitely a subject for future R&D)

## 101
genNFT, Optimism

```ERC721Votes``` ```DAOthxS DelegateS token```

**Delegate Council 101 DAOthxS, has a mission to launch a multichain ecosystem and eventually dissolve into an environment of its own.**

Properties: 

1 delegate vote VS 10,000 thxS votes, irrevocable.

Can be transferred, sold, delegated.

Receives 1/101 of Vault 101 (5% of each TGE. 21 x 50,000 = 1,050,000 all chain)

Allocation: 

Thank you, Satoshi = 1 ``<on demand>``

TGE Team lead = 21

DAOthxS multisigS custodians = 6 genNFT (OP) + 5 genNFT (BTC) - 11.

All future multisig custodians (I understand there will be many multisigs, at least until the end of the TGE phase) will be chosen from custodians 101 until the community via proposal changes this.

Partners who helped with the launch will get 5 genNFT (currently clear 1, @Menaskop from DAOSynergis). In my opinion it will be great if Forklog is interested in this. Optimism 

Total: 38.

The rest sold via auction with a starting price of 0.01 eth. 1 per day and the money will go to DAOthxS in the treasury. The auction is organized similarly to NounsDAO.

Total: 63.
